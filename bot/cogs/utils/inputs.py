These can require a very unlikely series of keystrokes, mouse clicks, cheat codes, etc. to activate, meaning it is usually only other programmers with access to source code who can ferret these out. They can include special credit sequences for the development team, games, or jokes. Easter eggs can now be found in operating systems, hardware ROM, and DVD and Blu-ray movies. Up-Down-Up-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right-B-A-Start is a popular way to invoke an Easter Egg, as an homage to a Konami game which used this key sequence to access a cheat code",
