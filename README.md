A discord bot wrapped around the theme of tears and crying.
In concept, the idea is absurd but that's more of a reason to make this. :)
The bot uses tears as an economy and you can "cry" to get daily credit tears.

NOTE- It is recommended that you add your own discord token while running the bot.

- [Invite the bot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=627772985872220161&permissions=379968&scope=bot)
[*NOTE- The bot is still in v0.1 and is being constantly updated and bug fixed. Inviting this, might have unintentional complications. If you really want the bot, open an issue so that we can provide a Beta Version to you that is stable and updated slowly*]
- To test the bot join this [Support Server](https://discord.gg/jTzGuYx)
  [*NOTE- Bot is not active 24x7 as it is hosted on heroku. To get a sample, join* [TearDropsSupport](https://discord.gg/jTzGuYx) *and ping* **@Tissue**]

## Hosting the bot locally:

- NOTE: To replicate this bot, you will need a bot **token**. Go get yours at https://discord.com/developers/ (If you need help with this step, feel free to ask for help in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/jTzGuYx)).
- Clone this repo using `git clone`
- cd into the bot folder.
- For the token's you will have to set them manually. For assistance, contact **@Tissue** at [Support Server](https://discord.gg/jTzGuYx)
<!--TODO: add Tl,dr for getting the env. tokens-->
- Install discord.py module:
  ```
    python -m pip install discord.py
  ```
- Install requirements from requirements.txt
  ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the bot using: `python bot/main.py`
- Enjoy! (don't forget to add your own bot into your discord server by generating an invite link from the discord developers application page in [OAuth2 section](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and choose application and check Oauth2 section)
- You may do bug-reporting or ask for help in on the SupportServer... or just open an issue on this repo.

- python 3
- discord(rewrite branch)
- asyncio(inbuilt with python3.4)
